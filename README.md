# Credit Risk Analysis

# Overview
The purpose of this project is to use machine learning and a variety of algorithms to predict credit risk. The data used is from LendingClub, a peer-to-peer lending services company. The data is imbalanced, with a vast majority of the data being low risk. The data is cleaned and then split into training and testing data. The data is then run through a variety of algorithms to determine which is the most accurate. The algorithms used are: RandomOverSampler, SMOTE, ClusterCentroids, SMOTEENN, BalancedRandomForestClassifier, EasyEnsembleClassifier.
